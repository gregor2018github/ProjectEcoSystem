# ProjectEcoSystem

A predator-prey ecosystem simulation built with Python and Pygame. Predators hunt prey, prey consume grass, and grass regrows over time.

## Features

* 3 level ecosystem simulation with plants, prey, and predators
    Plants are the basis of the ecosystem, they get eaten by prey but regrow over time
    Prey searches for food and flees from predators
    Predators avoid other predators (unless too hungry) and hunt prey in their vicinity
* Real-time visualization
* Real-time key statistics
* Visualization of population trends over time in statistics screen
* Configurable parameters (speeds, reproduction rates, health values, etc.)
* Possibility to add predators or prey during runtime via buttons

## Requirements

* Python 3.10+
* Pygame
